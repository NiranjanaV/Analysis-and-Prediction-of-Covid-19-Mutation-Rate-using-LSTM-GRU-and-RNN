# Analysis-and-Prediction-of-Covid-19-Mutation-Rate-using-LSTM-GRU-and-RNN
# In this project, we calculated the mutation rate of nucleotide sequence and then implement Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) model, Simple Recurrent Neural Networks and Gated recurrent units (GRUs) to predict the future mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 virus. Further, we have also calculated the codon mutation rate of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
# Predicted the mutation rates in SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences in the near future using global and country-specific temporal genomic information. Implemented LSTM, RNN and GRU models for time series prediction of the future mutation rate and analyzed and compared model performances based on loss rate and true mutation rate.
