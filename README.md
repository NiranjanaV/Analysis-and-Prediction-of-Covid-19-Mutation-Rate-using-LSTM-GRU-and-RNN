# Analysis-and-Prediction-of-Covid-19-Mutation-Rate-using-LSTM-GRU-and-RNN
# In this project, we calculated the mutation rate of nucleotide sequence and then implement Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) model, Simple Recurrent Neural Networks and Gated recurrent units (GRUs) to predict the future mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 virus. Further, we have also calculated the codon mutation rate of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Analyzed and compared model performances based on loss rate and true mutation rate.
